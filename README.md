# Hacker-s-Island-
Hacker's Island is a 2D platformer / point and click adventure game made in Unity engine. The game is focused on story,exploration and learning. One of the main characteristics of the game is that you'll learn some of the effective ways on how you can protect yourself against hackers in real life. My main inspiration for deeloping this game is the show Mr. Robot.
