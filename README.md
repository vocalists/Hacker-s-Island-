# Hacker-s-Island-
Hacker's Island is a 2D platformer / point and click adventure game made in Unity engine. The game is focused on story,exploration and learning. One of the main characteristics of the game is that you'll learn some of the effective ways on how you can protect yourself against hackers in real life. My main inspiration for developing this game is the show Mr. Robot.

UPDATE:
I'm getting this error when i transfer files using git bash and I can't find the solution for this problem.
error: unable to write sha1 filename .git/objects/b7/674b4b7dcb809df8fb7496fd286c383f950bcd: Permission denied

In the meantime, the files can be access via bitbucket.
